# CSE_573_SWM_Fake_Review_Detection

Fake-Review-Detection
Detecting Fake Reviews from the Yelp Restaurant Reviews Dataset

We used three techniques to achieve the objective: Logisitic Regression, Random Forest and SVM. We also used PCA to reduce the dimensions and get the features. We used the Yelp Dataset which has data on several restaurants. Furthermore, we worked with multiple machine learning techniques and gradually improved the accuracy.
